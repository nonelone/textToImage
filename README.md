# textToImage
A simple PIL based script that generates images based on .txt file - it was created to work with .txt output from my ImageToASCII script and it might not work with other programs
It uses the symbols from this .txt file ( . : o 0 # ) to tell what image should be used to composite new image.
It uses images of this symbols to composite the image, but they can be easily swapped out.
 
NOTE: Works only with square images
